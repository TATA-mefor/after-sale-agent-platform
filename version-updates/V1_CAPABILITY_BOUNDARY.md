## V1 Capability Boundary

V1 includes:

- Ticket creation and ticket detail query APIs.
- Rule-based intent classification for the demo after-sale messages.
- In-memory after-sale policy retrieval.
- Tool boundary through `ToolRegistry`.
- Low-risk tool execution for `search_aftersale_policy` and `add_ticket_note`.
- `AgentRun` and `ToolCallTrace` records exposed through APIs.
- Architecture checks that prevent API/repository coupling, domain/Spring Web coupling, direct Agent repository access,
  direct tool repository access, and business-module dependency on Agent orchestration.

## V1 Does Not Do

- No real LLM provider.
- No real database, Redis, payment, refund, inventory, or logistics integration.
- No real order lookup tool in the final V1 implementation; the demo carries `orderId` on the ticket and focuses on
  policy evidence plus auditable tool execution.
- No complex frontend or production authentication.
- No multi-Agent orchestration.
- No automatic execution of high-risk actions.
